    "text": "Effective conservation starts with open scientific data\nActions to protect the planet’s biodiversity today rely on how ecosystems have responded to changing climate and land use in the past, but the data are not easy to find.\nAs a community effort, a European network of scientists is collecting data generated by researchers around the globe to support effective conservation actions. The goal is to provide public access to information on the response of ecosystems to land uses in the last decades and centuries but also to changing climate in the last millennia. This is analysed in the field of “palaeoecology” and allows identifying trends during long periods of time that help plan effective conservation and adaptation to climate change.\n“Much of the palaeoecological data are currently dispersed across different repositories, databases and largely not publicly available. We’ll bring much of these data into the public domain, harmonise their taxonomy and format using community coordinated practices, and make them relevant to nature conservation”” say the project leaders Thomas Giesecke, a palaeoecologist at Utrecht University (Netherlands) and Sandra Nogué Bosch, a biogeographer at CREAF (Spain).\nThis initiative called PalaeOpen is expected to gather more than 200 scientists and stakeholders from Europe to identify data gaps in continental conservation. “We will develop this action to determine access, ownership, and transparent appropriate conditions to share historical ecological data to guide future policy in biodiversity and conservation of our ecosystems”“, says Xavier Benito Granell, a researcher at the Institute of Agrifood and Technology Research, IRTA (Spain).”Working on a fair and open data sharing is particularly relevant to freshwater ecosystems, which have experienced one of the most dramatic declines across all habitats, by 85% since 1970”, says Stefan Engels at Birkbeck University (United Kingdom) and a working group lead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblack alder (Alnus glutinosa)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npubescent oak (Quercus pubescens)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblack pine (Pinus nigra)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Light microscope, 400x magnification. photo M.

In certain data communities, such as pollen, only a minor fraction of data remains inaccessible to the public, but for vertebrates and macrofossils, the entire process of data mobilization, harmonization, and integration must be undertaken from scratch”“, add Petr Kuneš at Charles University (Czech Republic) and a working group lead.\nScientists, practitioners and policy makers won’t be the only beneficiaries of PalaeOpen. Graciela Gil-Romera, a researcher at the Pyrenees Institute of Ecology (Spain) is leading educational and outreach activities to promote ecological heritage. “We have many ideas about how to bring scientific knowledge in an attractive and easy way that everyone can enjoy. For example, we are working on the creation of Wikipedia articles for as many places in Europe as possible where data is available, to link them to the OpenStreetMap app. The idea is that while we search for directions to find a place, we learn about its ecological value”“, she says.\nPalaeOpen is funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) and integrates 27 European countries. The network promotes inclusivity and values diverse knowledge from scientific experts to local practitioners and policy makers to create a real change in research culture.\nPalaeOpen website: https://bit.ly/PalaeOpen"

    "text": "Restoring and managing nature during times of rapid environmental change requires knowledge of ecosystem response to climate and land use change on timescales of decades to millennia. Different palaeoecological disciplines have collected relevant, site-specific data during the last decades. Much of the palaeoecological data are currently dispersed across different repositories, databases and largely not publicly available.\nThis Action aims to meet the challenge of bringing much of these data into the public domain, harmonise their taxonomy and metadata, and make them relevant to nature conservation. By combining domain specific repositories and databases, the Action will unlock these data collections and make them available for palaeoecological meta-analysis of ecosystem interactions on a continental scale. This will permit integrated analysis of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem responses to natural and anthropogenic environmental change for the first time. The Action will overcome the barriers between palaeoecologist, macroecologists and nature conservation practitioners by developing and engaging with a new research agenda.\nScientific workshops in different parts of Europe will provide formats to interact with local nature conservation practitioners. The research agenda will address the knowledge gaps in nature conservation as well as the need to understand continental scale interactions of ecosystem components, including lagged or threshold responses. A dedicated outreach working group will ensure that the new knowledge is also accessible to the public. Moreover, the group will develop educational material for schools and universities based on the collected data.\nCOST - Action CA23116 Join the network"
