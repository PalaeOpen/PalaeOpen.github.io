    "section": "",
    "text": "Effective conservation starts with open scientific data\nActions to protect the planet’s biodiversity today rely on how ecosystems have responded to changing climate and land use in the past, but the data are not easy to find.\nAs a community effort, a European network of scientists is collecting data generated by researchers around the globe to support effective conservation actions. The goal is to provide public access to information on the response of ecosystems to land uses in the last decades and centuries but also to changing climate in the last millennia. This is analysed in the field of “palaeoecology” and allows identifying trends during long periods of time that help plan effective conservation and adaptation to climate change.\n“Much of the palaeoecological data are currently dispersed across different repositories, databases and largely not publicly available. We’ll bring much of these data into the public domain, harmonise their taxonomy and format using community coordinated practices, and make them relevant to nature conservation”” say the project leaders Thomas Giesecke, a palaeoecologist at Utrecht University (Netherlands) and Sandra Nogué Bosch, a biogeographer at CREAF (Spain).\nThis initiative called PalaeOpen is expected to gather more than 200 scientists and stakeholders from Europe to identify data gaps in continental conservation. “We will develop this action to determine access, ownership, and transparent appropriate conditions to share historical ecological data to guide future policy in biodiversity and conservation of our ecosystems”“, says Xavier Benito Granell, a researcher at the Institute of Agrifood and Technology Research, IRTA (Spain).”Working on a fair and open data sharing is particularly relevant to freshwater ecosystems, which have experienced one of the most dramatic declines across all habitats, by 85% since 1970”, says Stefan Engels at Birkbeck University (United Kingdom) and a working group lead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblack alder (Alnus glutinosa)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npubescent oak (Quercus pubescens)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblack pine (Pinus nigra)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Light microscope, 400x magnification. photo M.

Okoljska arheologija in paleoekologija, Ljubljana, Založba ZRC\n\n\n\nAs palaeoecology involves many sub-disciplines and data management is a branch of science itself, participants in PalaeOpen are contributing to different working groups from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems, data storage and management, each of them with their own challenges. “When we talk about terrestrial environments, we refer to remains of plants and pollen, bones of vertebrates, charcoal, and insects, but also to abiotic data that characterize soil erosion. In certain data communities, such as pollen, only a minor fraction of data remains inaccessible to the public, but for vertebrates and macrofossils, the entire process of data mobilization, harmonization, and integration must be undertaken from scratch”“, add Petr Kuneš at Charles University (Czech Republic) and a working group lead.\nScientists, practitioners and policy makers won’t be the only beneficiaries of PalaeOpen. Graciela Gil-Romera, a researcher at the Pyrenees Institute of Ecology (Spain) is leading educational and outreach activities to promote ecological heritage. “We have many ideas about how to bring scientific knowledge in an attractive and easy way that everyone can enjoy. For example, we are working on the creation of Wikipedia articles for as many places in Europe as possible where data is available, to link them to the OpenStreetMap app. The idea is that while we search for directions to find a place, we learn about its ecological value”“, she says.\nPalaeOpen is funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) and integrates 27 European countries. The network promotes inclusivity and values diverse knowledge from scientific experts to local practitioners and policy makers to create a real change in research culture.\nPalaeOpen website: https://bit.ly/PalaeOpen\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "IAL-IPA PalaeOpen workshop\n\n  \n \n  \n\n\nAs part of the IAL-IPA symposium held in Aix-les-Bains (France), a 1-day workshop was held at the Université Savoie Mont Blanc, in Le Bourget-du-Lac. The workshop brought together ca 30 attendees as well as 4 instructors, and participants included both people who had attended previous PalaeOpen activities such as the Chironomid & Diatom workshop in N Macedonia or the Open Science Meeting in the Czech Republic, as well as people completely new to the COST Action. Some people travelled from countries such as Mexico, the US or China, meaning the reach of this workshop extended beyond the typical COST countries.\nThe program included an introductory lecture by the organisers, an overview of recent work on the sedaDNA constituent database (held by Trisha Spanbauer; University of Northern Kentucky, US) and hands-on training on data uploading through Tilia. The particular focus of the latter was on merging datasets (e.g. adding a diatom dataset to an existing pollen dataset) as well as on taxonomy. The full-day program ran from 10am to after 4pm, and the instructors received very positive feedback from some of the attendees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Participants learning Tilia (software to structure data and metadata for Neotoma uploads) at the workshop. Photo credit: Stefan Engels.\n\n\n\nWe were able to financially support 13 people through our PalaeOpen budget, which meant our logo was shown on many talks and posters during the symposium as well. We also presented PalaeOpen-focussed work at the IAL-IPA in a poster (Stefan Engels) and a talk (Thomas Giesecke). A final highlight was the ECR-led PalaeOpen social on the Friday dinner; an ad hoc activity that attracted 23 colleagues and saw the establishment of a PalaeOpen whatsapp group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proud participants with the PalaeOpen flag\n\n\n\n\nPoster\nDownload the poster here\nWalter Finsinger, Xavier Benito and Stefan Engels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "My STSM Experience in Vancouver\n\n  \n \n  \n\n\nIn August 2025, I had the chance to spend a Short-Term Scientific Mission (STSM) in Vancouver, Canada, as part of the PalaeOpen COST Action. I worked closely with Dr. Simon Goring and Socorro Dominguez Vidaña on the Neotoma Paleoecology Database. But more than that—it was a week full of productive work, fresh ideas, and the kind of collaboration that happens best when you’re walking a dog or cooking together at home.\n\n👨‍🔬Who?\nOndřej Mottl\nQuantitative Ecology Lab, Department of Botany, Charles University, Prague, Czechia\n\n\n🌍Where?\nVancouver, Canada\n\n\n📅When?\nAugust 2025\n\nThis wasn’t your usual desk-bound work visit. Since I was staying just a few houses down from Simon, we ended up working from my place most days. The setting was relaxed but focused—we dove into all things Neotoma: its architecture, data access protocols, and the challenges of keeping such a massive database running smoothly. With Bailey (Simon’s dog) often napping nearby, we mapped out ways I could help from Europe with data quality control and issue resolution.\nOne of the goals was to get me fully onboarded as a contributor to Neotoma. That meant learning how the database works from the inside, gaining full access, and beginning to build tools that others can use. I also got to help improve the way we present Neotoma information to R users, including ideas for a new website interface and more intuitive documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The whole team working together. Photo credit: Simon Goring.\n\n\n\nOf course, it wasn’t all code and data. We took breaks for long walks with Bailey through the neighborhood. We shared meals, visited a few local restaurants, and talked about science, careers, and how to make palaeoecological data more open and useful across the world. It was in these informal moments that some of the best ideas emerged.\nWhat I appreciated most about this STSM was how seamlessly the technical blended with the human. I returned to Prague not only with new skills and responsibilities but also with a sense of connection—to the Neotoma team, to the broader community, and to the idea that good science often starts with good conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Simon, Socorro, and Bailey at Capilano Park.

I look forward to what comes next—both online and, hopefully, in future face-to-face collaborations.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Restoring and managing nature during times of rapid environmental change requires knowledge of ecosystem response to climate and land use change on timescales of decades to millennia. Different palaeoecological disciplines have collected relevant, site-specific data during the last decades. Much of the palaeoecological data are currently dispersed across different repositories, databases and largely not publicly available.\nThis Action aims to meet the challenge of bringing much of these data into the public domain, harmonise their taxonomy and metadata, and make them relevant to nature conservation. By combining domain specific repositories and databases, the Action will unlock these data collections and make them available for palaeoecological meta-analysis of ecosystem interactions on a continental scale. This will permit integrated analysis of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem responses to natural and anthropogenic environmental change for the first time. The Action will overcome the barriers between palaeoecologist, macroecologists and nature conservation practitioners by developing and engaging with a new research agenda.\nScientific workshops in different parts of Europe will provide formats to interact with local nature conservation practitioners. The research agenda will address the knowledge gaps in nature conservation as well as the need to understand continental scale interactions of ecosystem components, including lagged or threshold responses. A dedicated outreach working group will ensure that the new knowledge is also accessible to the public. Moreover, the group will develop educational material for schools and universities based on the collected data.\nCOST - Action CA23116 Join the network\n\n\nCOST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) is a funding agency for research and innovation networks.

    "text": "My STSM Experience in Utrecht\n\n  \n \n  \n\n\nIn the spring of 2025, I had the opportunity to spend a Short-Term Scientific Mission (STSM) at Utrecht University as part of the PalaeOpen COST Action. My mission focused on data mobilisation and acquisition.\n\n👩‍🔬Who?\nEliise Kara (Early Career Researcher)\nDepartment of Geology, Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia\n\n\n🌍Where?\nUtrecht University, Netherlands\n\n\n📅When?\nSpring of 2025\n\nOne of the central goals of my STSM was to receive training in data stewardship. This was carried out under the guidance of Iris Kuipers, Iris de Wolf, and Dr. Thomas Giesecke. The training gave me practical insight into how to prepare and share palaeoecological datasets. The process was challenging at times, but working directly with the Estonian pollen datasets that my colleagues had entrusted to me provided essential hands-on experience. I’m grateful to my colleagues at Utrecht University who patiently supported me throughout this process. I quickly learned that data mobilisation is both a technical and human process - it takes a lot of collaboration, patience and to attention to detail.\nWhile I still have more to learn before I can act independently as a data steward, this STSM gave me a solid foundation and the motivation to continue developing in that direction. I’m particularly motivated by the prospect of helping to make Estonian palaeoecological data more accessible to the wider scientific community.\nI also had the chance to advance my PhD research, thanks to access to fluorescence microscopy facilities (Figure 1) and the guidance of Prof. Dr. Friederike Wagner-Cremer. Together, we obtained a new microphenological dataset that holds great potential for reconstructing growing season dynamics during the Estonian Late Glacial period with high precision. Once this relatively new type of data is made openly available, it will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of biodiversity and climate change interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Analysing subfossil leaf cuticles with the fluorescent microscope in the microscopy room of Earth Simulation Laboratory (Utrecht University, the Netherlands). Photo credit: Eliise Kara.\n\n\n\nOf course, the STSM was also about people—this experience deepened my connection to the European palaeoecology community, strengthened collaboration between Estonia and the Netherlands, and opened doors for future joint research efforts. I returned home with new skills, ideas, data, and a renewed sense of enthusiasm for continuing this work. Experiencing the Netherlands in full bloom and under exceptionally sunny skies (Figure 2) also added to the motivation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A Sunday afternoon with tulips in Keukenhof. Photo credit: Eliise Kara.\n\n\n\nI’m grateful to my hosts at Utrecht University and to the PalaeOpen Action for supporting this journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
